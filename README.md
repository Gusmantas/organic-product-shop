# organic-product-shop
Shopping page where user can buy organic products.

Project uses Firebase realtime database to get the data. Written in Angular. It uses Firebase login system so user is able to log in using google account. If data in not being displayed - it means that the database needs to be re-enabled due to long inactivity (since I use free firebase plan). Give me a shout and I will fix it.

To run the source code: 
* First run `npm install` in project directory
* Then run `ng serve` to run the app on port 4200 (default)
